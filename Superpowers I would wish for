Everyone wishes to have some superpowers at some point in their lives. I don't know for sure if there is a celestial being which is the responsibile for my existence. But, there is a possibility that I could meet this being after death in some energy form.
If the being asks me what superpowers I want, then I would ask for the following 

1. Reality Warping
2. Space-Time Manipulation
3. Existence Erasure
4. Chaos Manipulation
5. Dimensional Phasing
6. Power Nullification
7. Probability Manipulation
8. Telepathy
9. Mind Control
10. Memory Altercation
11. Astral Projection
12. Sentience Transfer
13. Precognition
14. Ultra Healing
15. Immortality
16. Elemental Manipulation
17. Gravity Control
18. Energy Absorption
19. Transmutation
20. Super Plasticity
21. Psychokinesis
22. Clairvoyance
23. Universal Awareness
24. Xray Vision
25. Size Augmentation
26. Conjuration
27. Duplication
28. Omnilingualism
29. Metamorphosis
30. Invisibility

I could have simply wished for Omnipresence, Omnipotence, Omniscience and simply become the being myself but I am not sure if that would brings existential problems to self.
